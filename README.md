This project is a sollution to the Renewable Energy Explorer challenge in Nasa's Space App Challange Gothenburg, Sweden 2013.

Stunningly, the percentage of renewable energy in Earth's total supply has actually decreased over the last 40 years. 
What happened to our world becoming more conscious, and not least, now having access to much more sophisticated technology than in the 70’s? 
Why haven’t we improved our green energy ratio?

Enerview shows the story behind this reality through an interactive data visualisation application and points out a path towards positive change by mapping out the potential of renewable energy on our planet in an intuitive and engaging way.
